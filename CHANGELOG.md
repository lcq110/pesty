# Changelog

All notable changes to Pesty are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Release builds with CloudKit now require a matching Developer ID provisioning
  profile, extract their signing entitlements from that profile, and verify the
  final application and team identifiers before publication.
- The release workflow no longer publishes ad-hoc signed builds as if CloudKit
  were available.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-07

> Retracted for CloudKit testing: the downloadable artifact was ad-hoc signed
> and did not contain a Developer ID provisioning profile.

### Added
- iOS companion app, custom keyboard, share extension, and CloudKit-backed
  snapshot synchronization from the `codex/ios-companion` branch.

### Fixed
- The macOS global shortcut now opens Pesty on the currently active Space
  without switching back to the Space where Pesty was previously shown.
- Shortcut toggling no longer treats a panel visible only on another Space as
  visible on the current Space.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-26

Visual overhaul to match Paste, plus iCloud sync.

### Added
- iCloud Drive sync (opt-in) for history and pinboards across your Macs.
- Live Accessibility permission status in Settings, with a Restart button.

### Changed
- Redesigned cards: per-source-app colored header band, app-icon tile, type
  label, verbose relative time, and a footer with character count + quick-paste
  number — a faithful match to Paste.
- Spring animations for selection, hover, and scrolling; taller default strip.
- Top bar now has a sync toggle, search indicator, a "Clipboard" tab, and a
  "…" overflow menu.

### Fixed
- Search input and keyboard navigation reliability.
- Removed the unnecessary Apple Events entitlement.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-26

Initial public release.

### Added
- Slide-up clipboard strip with a global hotkey (default `⌘⇧V`).
- Color-coded cards for text, rich text, links, images, files, and colors, each
  showing source app, editable title, copy time, preview, and character count.
- Pinboards: named, color-tagged collections of saved clips.
- Instant search across the full history.
- Keyboard navigation: arrows to move, `return` to paste, `⌘1`–`⌘9` quick-paste,
  `⌘⌫` to delete, `esc` to close.
- Direct paste into the previously active app via synthesized `⌘V`.
- Privacy: ignores concealed (password-manager) clips.
- Menu-bar item, preferences window, configurable hotkey, launch at login.
- Universal binary (Apple Silicon + Intel), signed with Developer ID and
  notarized by Apple.
